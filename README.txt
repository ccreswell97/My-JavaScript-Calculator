Build a web application that has a simple calculator on it. This calculator needs to have buttons for the user to interact with it.

The page must feature a calculator that has buttons so users can enter any non-negative integer. It also needs to support the following mathematical functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also needs an equals button so that it performs the entered operations and a clear button to clear out the user input.

Each of those operations should have an HTML element with an ID as follows:

 Addition: "plus"

 Subtraction: "minus"

 Multiplication: "times"

 Division: "divide"

 Equals: "equals"

 Clear: "clear"

Likewise, the number buttons should have IDs that correspond to their English names (one, two, three, four, five, etc.; 0 should be zero, not zed). Finally, the element that contains the display figure (either the number entered or the output of the operation) should have an ID of "output".

Like a simple calculator, the user should be able to click buttons to enter a number, and then press an operation and then key in another number. If the user clicks the equal button, it will perform the operation. However, the user can choose to do another mathematical operation instead, so they can perform complex operations.

If the user clicks the equals button and receives their results, they can choose to do another mathematical operation on the number or enter in a new number that replaces the old. Put another way, typing a new number after receiving a result should perform an implicit clear operation. This functionality should be similar to the default Windows or Mac calculator, in that regard.

The calculator needs to be mathematically accurate.
